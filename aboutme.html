          <p>Bhutan is seeing a steady rise in many health issues over the years, and we often overlook the importance of our gut in combating such issues of the health .
Gut health is perhaps the most overlooked in our society today. as we battle numerous kinds of diseases  and most often untreatable ones at that, both physical and mental. what we fail to understand is that the most important part of our body to prevent and treat todays health issues might just start with the Gut. </p>

          <p> According to recent studies,  we have around 39 to 300 trillion bacteria living inside of us. a healthy balanced diet consisting of various vegetables and fruits along with Probiotics, which are a certain type of friendly bacteria, provide health benefits when eaten. Having the right gut bacteria has been shown to provide many health benefits, such as:
<ul>
<li>Good Digestion</li>
<li> Improved Immune System</li>
<li> Mental Clarity</li>
<li>Reduced Cholestrol</li>
<li>weight Managment</li>
</ul>

It is with this mission in mind. I would like to empower and inform my small society about the importance of having a healthy balanced microbiome (gut) and the many benefits of including a probiotic diet  so that one can flourish and live their best productive lives.</p>
